# GenWise Under Financial Strain
### No surplus projected for 2025

- **Could we revisit pricing framework** to enable scale & access?

<!-- presenter: Use this as a prompt for conversation—not a direct ask. Present as “opportunities for deeper partnership.” -->

# Pricing Framework
### Current
- We thank MAHE for offering students this fantastic experience **at cost**
- Rs 2200 per day per person, for up to 150 persons; Rs 1900 per day per person, if we cross this number

### Our Humble Request
- As we scale from 165 (2024) to 800+ (2029), we request your consideration to review this to a (Fixed + Variable) model

<!-- presenter: Use this as a prompt for conversation—not a direct ask. Present as “opportunities for deeper partnership.” -->
